#### Overview
This project aims to predict:
Classification of Crime Types: The model can be used to classify crimes into different categories such as "Violence," "Drugs," "Other" based on the description and offense code.
Sentencing Time Analysis: Analyses can uncover trends in judgments based on historical sentencing data using date columns and sentencing years.
Parole Prediction: A model can determine the factors influencing decisions for parole and predict which cases are more likely to be approved for parole.
Detection of Discrimination Patterns: Data analysis can reveal potential discrimination patterns based on race or gender in sentencing or parole decisions. We will use decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, gradient boosting models, naive Bayes, logistic regression, linear regression for prediction.

#### Duplicate rows handling
- In our dataset we had 91598 rows, from which 1 was a duplicate row, which we handled.

- This is what our dataset's row look like after removing duplicate rows:

#### Handling null values
- In our dataset were found various types of columns with null values:
- ![image](https://github.com/Albiona00/CriminalJustice-ML/assets/74986994/e82ff7b7-0105-4c2d-bb44-877fc4f9eaa5)

-This is after we handled null values:

#### Handling missing values
- Number of missing values before handling:

- For handling missing values of 'Offense Description' column we used 'Offense Code' to fill missing values and any remaining null values are filled with 'Unknown'.
- Number of rows after handling missing values:

#### Aggregation
- We conducted an aggregation by calculating the duration between two key dates: the 'Offense Date' and the 'Sentence Date', resulting in a new column named 'Between Days'.

#### Data transformation
- We converted the values of the "Sentence (Years)" column into integers:

- Now this is what our dataset's datatype look, after all the changes we've done:

#### Feature engineering
- From the "Sentence (Years)" column, we created two new columns: "Sentence numeric" and "Sentence scaled", where we transformed the data from a range into integer values:

## Phase 2: Model Training

In this phase, we trained the model using three different algorithms like: Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistic regression, assessing precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy across various data split ratios: 70% for training and 30% for testing, 80% for training and 20% for testing, and 90% for training and 10% for testing.

- Case 1:
In Case 1, we utilize a 70/30 split for training and testing, respectively.
