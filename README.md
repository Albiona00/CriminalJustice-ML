#### Overview
This project aims to predict:
Classification of Crime Types: The model can be used to classify crimes into different categories such as "Violence," "Drugs," "Other" based on the description and offense code.
Sentencing Time Analysis: Analyses can uncover trends in judgments based on historical sentencing data using date columns and sentencing years.
Parole Prediction: A model can determine the factors influencing decisions for parole and predict which cases are more likely to be approved for parole.
Detection of Discrimination Patterns: Data analysis can reveal potential discrimination patterns based on race or gender in sentencing or parole decisions.

- Check for Null Values:In handling null values based on the provided data, we first addressed the missing values in the 'Offense Description' column by filling them using the corresponding 'Offense Code'. Subsequently, any null values in the 'Sentence Date' and 'Offense Date' columns were replaced with 'Unknown'. This process ensured that the dataset was cleansed of null values, allowing for further analysis and modeling with complete data.

- Find and Remove Outliers: We detected outliers using Z-Score and and subsequently remove or adjust them to mitigate their potential impact on skewing the predictions of the model.

- Aggregation: We conducted an aggregation by calculating the duration between two key dates: the 'Offense Date' and the 'Sentence Date', resulting in a new column named 'Between Days'.Also we transformed the 'Sentence (Years)' column into numerical values and segmented it into ranges.

- Implement SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)-to address imbalanced classes by oversampling the minority class, thereby balancing the dataset. This approach aims to improve the model's capacity to learn from minority instances effectively, with a specific focus on the 'Offense' class imbalance. We will evaluate the dataset's performance both before and after applying the SMOTE technique.
